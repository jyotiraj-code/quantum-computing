## 🧠 About the Course

**Basics of Quantum Information** is the first course in the *Understanding Quantum Information and Computation* series, designed by **John Watrous**, a leading figure in quantum computing theory.

This foundational course explores:
- The **mathematics** of quantum information (vectors, states, operators)
- **Quantum circuits** as a formal framework for computation
- Core entanglement-based protocols:
  - 🧞‍♂️ Quantum Teleportation  
  - 📦 Superdense Coding  
  - 🎲 CHSH Game / CHSH Inequality

It’s ideal for students and professionals in **Physics**, **Computer Science**, **Mathematics**, and **Engineering** who are starting out in the theory of quantum computation.

**Credential Issuer:** IBM
