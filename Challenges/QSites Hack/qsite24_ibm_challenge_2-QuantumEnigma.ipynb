    "This challenge is based on the Quantum Enigmas produced by Institut Quantique at the Universit√© de Sherbrooke. Watch this video to see the details of the Quantum Enigma entitled ***The Four-Square Chessboard***: https://youtu.be/UuVbtFXOEKQ?feature=shared .\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you will code the solution to the enigma using Qiskit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code required to complete the exercise should be typed under the line which has the `## WRITE YOUR CODE BELOW HERE ##` comment. Avoid making changes to any provided code as this could alter how other code in the notebook functions. You will submit answers to the grader methods that are called in this notebook. This lab has 4 graded exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Four-Square Chessboard enigma is summarized as follows. Alice and Bob play a game in which Bob must find the location of a key hidden under one of the squares of a chessboard. Each chessboard square also has a coin with one side labeled 0 and the other side labeled 1, and each coin is placed randomly on one of these two sides. Alice must indicate the location of the hidden key to Bob by only flipping one coin on the board. Bob is provided with no information except the state of the chessboard after Alice flips the coin (i.e. he does not know which coin Alice flipped).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of the chessboard with the coin values shown in the video, with the example location of the key in red. However, the board could be in any configuration. In this case, there are 64 possible configurations, i.e. 16 possible coin configurations $\\times$ 4 possible key locations.\n",

    "Alice and Bob come into the game with a strategy to allow Bob to find the key given the rules of the game. It is based on computing parities of the coin values on the board. Alice will flip a coin based on her calculation of the partities of the key location expressed in binary, and a focus square location that is chosen by computing the parities of coins on the board. Bob will repeat this parity calculation of the coins on the board in order to find the location of the key.\n",
